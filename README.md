## About
Viranos is an iOS app developed using the CardinalKit Framework to help patients suffering from long-term COVID-19, where patients experience ongoing symptoms like fatigue, fever and memory lapses. Our app aims to provide support and symptom monitoring for these patients while also serving as a data collection tool to enable researchers to better understand the long-term sequelae of COVID-19.
