		<key>Overview</key>
		<string>Viranos is a platform developed to help COVID-19 patients monitor their health following diagnosis while also providing researchers and clinicians the tools to improve the understanding of long-term physical and psychosocial effects of the disease. 

The app allows users to fill out periodic surveys to monitor the progression of their symptoms, complete various tasks to assess metrics such as short-term memory, and incorporates data from iPhone and Apple Watch sensors to create a multi-faceted, longitudinal view of a patient‚Äôs COVID-19 progression. 

Get started by creating a profile and filling out the background questionnaire. Then, complete the COVID-19 questionnaire and Memory Task periodically to track changes over time. All of your data is easily viewable and accessible in the dashboard section of the app.
